## Overview
This is a project on the Pomodoro app challenge from frontend mentor. Recieved through Amalitech Training Programme
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Set a pomodoro timer and short & long break timers
- Customize how long each timer runs for
- See a circular progress bar that updates every minute and represents how far through their timer they are
- Customize the appearance of the app with the ability to set preferences for colors and fonts

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - JS library

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

Learnt how to how to execute scripts after every specific time in javascript using the setInerval function

function startTimer(){
    int=setInterval(displayTimer,1000);
}
An example in the function above, when ran, will execute "displayTimer" exery second

```js
function startTimer(){
    int=setInterval(displayTimer,1000);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on javascript and logic. Finding about ways to execute the task was really exciting. Also continue with css and learn more about styling.

### Useful resources

- [jQuery learning center](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-an-animated-countdown-timer-with-html-css-and-javascript/) - This helped me understand how to implement svg for the timer face. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [jQuery learning center](https://learn.jquery.com/) - This is an help page which helped me understand more about jQuery. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
